# Copilot for Mac

**Copilot for Mac** is a lightweight, unofficial Electron wrapper around the Microsoft Copilot web interface.
It provides a dedicated macOS desktop experience with familiar menus, keyboard shortcuts, and several quality-of-life tools on top of the standard Copilot website.

> This project does **not** modify or replace the official Copilot service. It simply loads the official site in an Electron shell.

---

## Version

* **Current app version:** `v1.0.0`
* **Status:** Stable hobby / personal-use build

---

## Features

**Dedicated desktop experience**

* Copilot in its own macOS app, separate from your browser
* Standard macOS menus (App, File, Edit, View, Window, Help)

**View & window controls**

* Reload page (Cmd/Ctrl + R)
* Zoom In / Zoom Out / Reset Zoom
* Toggle Fullscreen
* Toggle **Always on Top** for quick reference

**Export tools**

* Save the current page as **PDF** (print-to-PDF)
* Save the current page as **plain text**
* Capture a **screenshot** of the app window and save to PNG

**Navigation helpers**

* Copy current page URL to clipboard
* Open current page in the default system browser

**Notes window**

* Separate Notes window for quick notes and prompts
* Notes stored locally via `localStorage` on your machine
* Keyboard shortcut to open notes (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N)

**Global hotkey**

* System-wide shortcut (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + G) to show/hide the main Copilot window

## Installation

### Option 1: Download the DMG (recommended)

Download the latest macOS build from GitHub Releases:

* **Latest DMG:**
  [https://github.com/SomeWhiteTrashGuy/copilot-mac/releases/latest](https://github.com/SomeWhiteTrashGuy/copilot-mac/releases/latest)

Steps:

1. Download the `.dmg` file from the latest release.
2. Open the `.dmg`.
3. Drag **Copilot for Mac.app** into your **Applications** folder.
4. Launch it from Applications or Spotlight.
5. On first launch, macOS may warn you about an “unidentified developer”:

   * Right-click the app → **Open** → confirm, or
   * Approve it under **System Settings → Privacy & Security** if needed.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SomeWhiteTrashGuy/copilot-mac.git
cd copilot-mac
npm install

# Run in development
npm start
```

To build your own DMG:

```bash
npm run make
```

The built `.dmg` and other artifacts will be created under:

`out/make/`

## Supported MacBook Models

This is an Electron app; requirements are mostly about macOS version and general performance (RAM, SSD) rather than GPU.

### Verified (personally tested)

* **MacBook Pro (13" / 15", 2011, Intel)**

  * CPU: Intel Core i-series (dual- or quad-core)
  * Upgrades tested: 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD
  * OS: macOS Catalina (installed via community patcher)
  * Notes: Despite its age, the app runs reliably once a modern-enough macOS and Node/Electron are in place.

### Expected to work well (Intel MacBooks)

The app should generally work on the following Intel-based MacBook families, assuming:

* A reasonably recent macOS (e.g., High Sierra or later)
* SSD (strongly recommended)
* At least 8 GB of RAM

**MacBook Pro (Intel, roughly 2012–2015)**

* 13" and 15" unibody / Retina models
* Typical CPUs: Intel Core i5 / i7

**MacBook Air (Intel, roughly 2012–2017)**

* 11" and 13" models
* Low-power Intel Core i5 / i7
* Most ship with SSD, which is ideal for Electron apps

**MacBook (Retina, 12", 2015–2017, Intel)**

* Single USB-C port
* Intel Core M processors
* Performance is modest but sufficient for a simple Electron wrapper

### Apple Silicon (M1 / M2 / M3)

The app should also run on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) under Rosetta 2 like other Electron apps.
However, this configuration has **not** been extensively tested for this specific project.

> General rule: if your Mac can run a current-enough version of macOS to support the Electron version used here, it can probably run this app. SSD and sufficient RAM matter more than raw CPU speed.

## Known Limitations

* This is **not** a native Copilot client; it is a controlled browser window for the official site.
* All authentication, chat history, and AI behavior are handled by Microsoft’s servers.
* You must have:

  * A working internet connection
  * A valid Microsoft account with access to Copilot (depending on region/plan)
* On older Intel MacBooks, startup may be slower, especially on patched macOS versions or spinning hard drives.
